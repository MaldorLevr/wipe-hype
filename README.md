# Wipe Hype for Rust
Python script to join Rust servers immediately after a wipe while you're away from your computer.

Currently only works on Windows with Python 3.x and pyautogui installed.

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python wipehype.py`
3. The script will beging to wait for a Rust update and restart Steam and Rust to join your selected server (settings.json) once rust is updated.
